# How to contribute

To make sure that most of the aspects of contributing to OpenSource are covered when contributing to this repository, we have decided to have two sections to contribute to. They are:
1. A common file in which all contributors can contribute to. This is to make sure that contributors can collaborate on existing stuff when adding stuff.
2. A personal user level folder in which contributors will only contribute themselves. This is to make sure that they can individually add stuff themselves.

### Contribution file
The common file for contributions is the [index.html](./index.html) file. Please add yourself to the list of contributors in index.html as instructed below.

```html
...

<div>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]">
    <img src="[YOUR_GITHUB_IMAGE]" />
    <span>[YOUR_FULL_NAME]</span>
  </a>
</div>

<!-- ADD YOUR CARD BEFORE THIS LINE -->
```

### Before submitting
Before submitting your code please do the following steps:
1. Add any changes you want
2. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
3. When committing your changes make sure that you follow the structure of [semantic commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
4. Make sure that your PR only has one commit.
