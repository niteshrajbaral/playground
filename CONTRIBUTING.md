# How to contribute

To make sure that most of the aspects of contributing to OpenSource are covered when contributing to this repository, we have decided to have two sections to contribute to. They are:
1. A common file in which all contributors can contribute to. This is to make sure that contributors can collaborate on existing stuff when adding stuff.
2. A personal user level folder in which contributors will only contribute themselves. This is to make sure that they can individually add stuff themselves.

### Common file
The common file to contribute to is the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file in which you will add yourself among the contributors. Add yourself according to [this specification](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/specification).

### Personal directory
In the root level of this repository there is a folder `src`, inside it you will create a folder with the same name as your github username and inside it can be anything that you like to commit to this repository. When adding files and folders make sure that the files and folders are small in size if possible, because this repository is just for practicing.

### Before submitting
Before submitting your code please do the following steps:
1. Add any changes you want
2. Edit documentation if you have changed something significant
3. When committing your changes make sure that you follow the structure of [semantic commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
4. Make sure that your PR only has one commit.
